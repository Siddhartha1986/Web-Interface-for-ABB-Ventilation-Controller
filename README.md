# Web-Interface-for-ABB-Ventilation-Controller
- The interface is for displaying information from and Issuing commands to the 
ventilation controller simulator
- The simulator has two modes (Automatic and Manual) which should be able 
to be toggled from the web interface

# Programming language used:
- Front-end:
   - HTML / CSS / EJS / JavaScript
- Back-end:
   - Node.JS / JavaScript Runtime
- Simulator:
   - Python

# Tips to run the code for test purposes: 

- Run "controller.py" and "VSS.py," which are the ventilation controller simulator and Web-UI simulator. Open the simulators first by running the respective files.
- Keep the simulators on so that when you set the pressure or fan speed from the Web UI, you can view it live in the simulators later.
- Then, run the "server.js" file, which will operate on localhost:4000.
- Once the Web UI opens, log in with the credentials: sidd@gmail.com and password: 12345.
- After that, you can follow this [User Manual](https://github.com/Siddhartha1986/Web-Interface-for-ABB-Ventilation-Controller/blob/main/user_manual.pdf)
